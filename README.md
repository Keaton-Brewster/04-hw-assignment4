Quiz Code
=====
### Homework assignment for week 4 of bootcamp

After learning about API, following a week on javascript, 
I was given the assignment to make an interactive quiz that covers the topics
of APIs
I have included the user story and acceptance criteria, as provided to me, at the bottom of the README. 


#### User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```


#### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
Here I should note that I did chose to make a couple of changes in my code that 
do not exactly match the acceptance criteria. However I feel that I changes I made are inconsequential to the
functionality and goal of the assignment

> I made the subject matter related to Smash Bros by Nintendo
