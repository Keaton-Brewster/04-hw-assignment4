### JavaScript powered Super Smash Brothers Quiz

After learning about API, following a week on javascript, 
I was given the assignment to make an interactive quiz that covers the topics
of APIs
I have included the user story and acceptance criteria, as provided to me. 


#### User Story

> AS A coding boot camp student  
> I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores  
> SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers  

#### Acceptance Criteria

> GIVEN I am taking a code quiz  
> WHEN I click the start button  
> THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question  
> WHEN I answer a question  
> THEN I am presented with another question  
> WHEN I answer a question incorrectly  
> THEN time is subtracted from the clock  
> WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0  
> THEN the game is over  
> WHEN the game is over  
> THEN I can save my initials and score  


I will note that I did chose to make a couple of changes to my design that do not _exactly_ match the acceptance criteria. 
However I feel that the difference is minor and does not impact the functionality and goal of the assignment

* I made the subject matter related to Super Smash Bros by Nintendo  
* The assignment does call for a code quiz, but I just found this subject matter more entertaining  
* Functionally, the app works as requested.
